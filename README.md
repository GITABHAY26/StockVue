# Stock_trading_Dashboard

This is my learning React-based frontend Dashboard project, coupled with Tailwind CSS, presents real-time stock trading data through dynamic graphs illustrating trends over time.
Users gain access to comprehensive company details alongside indicators of stock performanceâ€”whether up or down. 
Leveraging React's core concepts such as state management, hooks, and context APIs,
the dashboard ensures seamless user interaction and real-time updates. Integration with the Finnhub API enriches the dashboard with free data features, 
enabling users to fetch detailed stock-related information effortlessly. This project encapsulates modern frontend development practices,
empowering users with insightful analytics for informed decision-making in the stock market.
